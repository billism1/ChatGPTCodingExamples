> Write code to parse names from lines from a CSV file.

---

Sure, here is some example code to parse names from lines in a CSV file using Python:

python

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        # assuming the name is in the first column
        name = row[0]
        # splitting the name into first and last name assuming there's a space between them
        first_name, last_name = name.split(' ')
        print('First name:', first_name)
        print('Last name:', last_name)
```

In this example, we're using Python's built-in `csv` module to read the CSV file. We then iterate over each row in the file, and assume that the name is in the first column of each row. We split the name into first and last name assuming there's a space between them, and then print out each name separately.

Note that this code assumes that all the names in the file are formatted with a space between the first and last name. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to handle different name formats.
