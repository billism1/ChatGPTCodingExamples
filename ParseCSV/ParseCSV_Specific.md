Here is an example C# code snippet that you can use to parse names from lines of a CSV file:

csharp

```csharp
using System.IO;

string filePath = "path/to/your/csv/file.csv";

using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
{
    while (!reader.EndOfStream)
    {
        var line = reader.ReadLine();

        // Check if line starts with a quote character
        if (!line.StartsWith("\""))
        {
            // Split line into columns based on tab delimiter
            var columns = line.Split('\t');

            // Get name from second column
            string name = columns[1];

            // Do something with the name
            Console.WriteLine(name);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `StreamReader` class to read the CSV file line by line. We check if the line starts with a quote character using the `StartsWith` method, and if it doesn't, we split the line into columns using the `Split` method with a tab delimiter (`\t`). We then extract the name from the second column (`columns[1]`) and do something with it. In this example, we simply print the name to the console using `Console.WriteLine`. You can replace this line with whatever processing you need to do with the name.
