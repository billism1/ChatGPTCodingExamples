> What programming is used in this code?
```
NSDate *dateOfHire = [employee dateOfHire];
if (dateOfHire != nil)
{
    // handle this case
}
```

The code appears to be written in Objective-C, which is a programming language commonly used for developing iOS and macOS applications.

In particular, the code uses the Objective-C syntax for calling a method on an object. The method `dateOfHire` is called on an instance of the `employee` object, which presumably returns an `NSDate` object representing the date of hire.

The code then checks if the returned value is not `nil`, which means that the date of hire is available. If the date of hire is available, the code inside the if block will be executed.

Yes, that's correct. The code you provided is part of a sample Objective-C code snippet from the Apple Developer documentation. The code demonstrates how to call a method on an instance of an object and check if the returned value is not `nil`.
