One optimization that can be made to the query is to create an index on the columns `casenumber` and `partnumber` in the `table2` table. This will help the database engine efficiently locate the missing records.

Here's the revised query with the index creation statement:

sql

```sql
CREATE INDEX table2_casenumber_partnumber_idx ON table2 (casenumber, partnumber);

SELECT
    COUNT(t1.*)
FROM
    table1 t1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.casenumber = t2.casenumber
    AND t1.partnumber = t2.partnumber
WHERE
    t2.id IS NULL;
```

Note that creating an index may increase the time needed for writes to the `table2` table, but it will make read operations, like this query, faster.

If the index already exists, then the query should perform well. If you are still experiencing slow performance, you can consider the following:

1.  Make sure that the statistics for the table are up-to-date. PostgreSQL maintains statistics about the distribution of data in the table, which the query planner uses to determine the best query plan. You can run `ANALYZE table2;` to update the statistics for the `table2` table.
    
2.  Check the query plan to see if it's using the index. You can use the `EXPLAIN` command to see the plan that PostgreSQL is using to execute the query. If the index is not being used, the query plan will show a full table scan of `table2`, which will be slow.
    
3.  Consider reducing the number of records in the `table1` table. The larger the table, the longer the query will take to run. If there is a way to limit the number of records in this table, the query will be faster.
    

If none of these steps help, you may need to consider other options, such as partitioning the data, using a materialized view, or using a denormalized design to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.
