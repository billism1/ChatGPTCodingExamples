Sure, the equation in the image is the Reynolds Number equation, and it can be expressed in Python using the following code:

python

```python
rho = density_of_fluid  # fluid density [kg/m^3]
v = velocity_of_fluid  # fluid velocity [m/s]
L = characteristic_length_scale  # characteristic length scale [m]
mu = dynamic_viscosity_of_fluid  # dynamic viscosity of fluid [Pa.s]

Re = rho * v * L / mu  # Reynolds number
```

In the code above, you would need to replace `density_of_fluid`, `velocity_of_fluid`, `characteristic_length_scale`, and `dynamic_viscosity_of_fluid` with the actual values you are using in your problem. The resulting value of `Re` would be the Reynolds number for the given fluid flow conditions.
