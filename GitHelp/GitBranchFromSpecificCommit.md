> In a git repo, how do I branch off of a branch from a specific commit?

---

To branch off a branch from a specific commit in a Git repository, you can follow these steps:

1.  First, make sure you have the branch you want to branch off from checked out by running the command `git checkout <branch-name>`.
    
2.  Identify the specific commit you want to branch off from. You can use the `git log` command to see the commit history and find the commit hash you want to use.
    
3.  Run the command `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>` to create a new branch from the specific commit hash. Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name you want to give to the new branch and `<commit-hash>` with the hash of the commit you want to branch off from.
    

For example, if you want to create a new branch called "feature-branch" from a commit with the hash "abc123", you would run the following command:

css

```css
git checkout -b feature-branch abc123
```

This will create a new branch called "feature-branch" that is based off of the commit with the hash "abc123". You can now make changes to this branch without affecting the original branch you branched off from.
