> How do I delete a local branch in my git repo?

---

To delete a local branch in your Git repository, you can use the `git branch` command with the `-d` or `-D` option, followed by the name of the branch you want to delete.

Here are the steps to delete a local branch:

1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the local repository directory using the `cd` command.
2.  Run the command `git branch` to see a list of all local branches in your repository.
3.  Identify the name of the branch you want to delete from the list.
4.  Run the command `git branch -d <branchname>` to delete the branch. If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will give you a warning and will not allow you to delete the branch with the `-d` option. In that case, you can use the `-D` option instead to force the deletion of the branch.
5.  Verify that the branch has been deleted by running the `git branch` command again.

Here's an example of how to delete a local branch named "my-branch":

perl

```perl
$ git branch
  master
* my-branch
  another-branch

$ git branch -d my-branch
Deleted branch my-branch (was abc1234).

$ git branch
  master
  another-branch
*
``` 

Note: Be careful when deleting branches, as this action cannot be undone. Make sure you have committed all your changes and have merged any important changes from the branch you are deleting before deleting it.

---

To delete all local branches that have been deleted on the remote repository, you can use the `git fetch` command with the `--prune` option to fetch the latest changes from the remote and remove any local branches that no longer exist on the remote.

Here are the steps to delete all local branches that have been deleted on the remote:

1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the local repository directory using the `cd` command.
2.  Run the command `git fetch --prune` to fetch the latest changes from the remote and remove any local branches that no longer exist on the remote.
3.  Run the command `git branch -vv` to see a list of all local branches along with their upstream branches. Any local branches that have been deleted on the remote will have a `[gone]` tag next to their upstream branch.
4.  Run the command `git branch -d <branchname>` to delete each local branch that has been deleted on the remote. If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will give you a warning and will not allow you to delete the branch with the `-d` option. In that case, you can use the `-D` option instead to force the deletion of the branch.

Here's an example of how to delete all local branches that have been deleted on the remote:

bash

```bash
$ git fetch --prune
pruning origin
From github.com:user/repo
 - [deleted]         (none)     -> origin/deleted-branch
 - [deleted]         (none)     -> origin/another-deleted-branch

$ git branch -vv
  master     abc1234 [origin/master]
* my-branch  def5678 [origin/my-branch]
  old-branch 123abc [gone]     # Branch has been deleted on remote

$ git branch -d old-branch
Deleted branch old-branch (was 123abc).

$ git branch -vv
  master     abc1234 [origin/master]
* my-branch  def5678 [origin/my-branch]
```

Note: Be careful when deleting branches, as this action cannot be undone. Make sure you have committed all your changes and have merged any important changes from the branch you are deleting before deleting it.

> That seems tedious if you have a lot of branches that needs deleting. Can you generate a Powershell script that does all of that?

---

Sure, you can use the following PowerShell script to delete all local branches that have been deleted on the remote:

powershell

```powershell
# Change directory to the Git repository
cd C:\path\to\repo

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches
git fetch --prune

# Loop through all local branches and delete any that have been deleted on the remote
foreach ($branch in $(git branch -vv | where { $_ -match ": gone]" }) | foreach { $_.TrimStart('*').Trim() }) {
  git branch -D $branch
}
```

Here's how the script works:

1.  Change directory to the Git repository using the `cd` command.
2.  Run the command `git fetch --prune` to fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches.
3.  Use the `git branch -vv` command to get a list of all local branches along with their upstream branches. The `where` command filters the output to only include branches that have been deleted on the remote (i.e., those with the `: gone]` tag next to their upstream branch).
4.  Use the `foreach` loop to iterate over each local branch that has been deleted on the remote, and use the `git branch -D` command to delete each branch.

You can save this script to a PowerShell file with a `.ps1` extension and run it using the PowerShell command line or PowerShell ISE. Note that you may need to adjust the file path in the `cd` command to match the location of your Git repository. Also, be careful when running the script, as it will permanently delete any local branches that have been deleted on the remote. Make sure you have committed all your changes and have merged any important changes from the branch you are deleting before running the script.

> That doesn't work because "git branch -vv" returns text other than the branch name.

---

I apologize for the confusion. You're right that the `git branch -vv` command outputs additional information besides the branch name, so we need to adjust the PowerShell script to extract only the branch names.

Here's an updated PowerShell script that should work:

powershell

```powershell
# Change directory to the Git repository
cd C:\path\to\repo

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches
git fetch --prune

# Loop through all local branches and delete any that have been deleted on the remote
foreach ($branch in $(git branch -vv | Select-String -Pattern '\[gone\]' | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString().Split(' ')[2] })) {
  git branch -D $branch
}
```

Here's how the updated script works:

1.  Change directory to the Git repository using the `cd` command.
2.  Run the command `git fetch --prune` to fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches.
3.  Use the `git branch -vv` command to get a list of all local branches along with their upstream branches. The `Select-String` command filters the output to only include lines that contain the string `[gone]`. The `ForEach-Object` command extracts the branch name from each line by splitting the line into an array of words and selecting the third element (which is the branch name).
4.  Use the `foreach` loop to iterate over each local branch that has been deleted on the remote, and use the `git branch -D` command to delete each branch.

Again, please be careful when running this script, as it will permanently delete any local branches that have been deleted on the remote. Make sure you have committed all your changes and have merged any important changes from the branch you are deleting before running the script.

> That doesn't work either. The lines output by "git branch -vv" don't have the text "\[gone\]". They look like this:

> test-branch-2 8071137 \[origin/test-branch-2: gone\] Commit message here.

---

I apologize for the confusion. You're right that the `git branch -vv` command outputs additional information besides the branch name, and that the `[gone]` text may not always be present. Here's an updated PowerShell script that should work in this case:

powershell

```powershell
# Change directory to the Git repository
cd C:\path\to\repo

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches
git fetch --prune

# Get a list of all local branches
$local_branches = $(git branch --format '%(refname:short)')

# Get a list of all remote branches that have been deleted
$deleted_remote_branches = $(git branch -r --format '%(refname:short)' | Where-Object { $(git rev-parse $_@{upstream} 2>&1) -like '*not a valid*'})

# Loop through all local branches and delete any that have been deleted on the remote
foreach ($branch in $($local_branches | Where-Object { $deleted_remote_branches -contains $_ })) {
  git branch -D $branch
}
```

Here's how the updated script works:

1.  Change directory to the Git repository using the `cd` command.
2.  Run the command `git fetch --prune` to fetch the latest changes from the remote and prune any deleted branches.
3.  Use the `git branch --format` command to get a list of all local branches, using the `%()` format specifier to output only the branch name without any additional information.
4.  Use the `git branch -r --format` command to get a list of all remote branches, using the `%()` format specifier to output only the branch name without any additional information. The `Where-Object` command filters the output to only include remote branches that have been deleted (i.e., those with an invalid upstream branch).
5.  Use the `foreach` loop to iterate over each local branch that has been deleted on the remote (i.e., those that appear in `$deleted_remote_branches`), and use the `git branch -D` command to delete each branch.

Again, please be careful when running this script, as it will permanently delete any local branches that have been deleted on the remote. Make sure you have committed all your changes and have merged any important changes from the branch you are deleting before running the script.

>> Note: This ended up being incorrect. I ended up Googling "powershell script to delete local branches that are not on remote" and the first response yielded the correct combination of commands, which I created a script from:

```
#Fetch the latest from the git
git pull --prune

#Delete all local branches that have been merged to main branch
git branch -vv | where {$_ -match '\[origin/.*: gone\]'} | foreach { git branch -d $_.split(" ", [StringSplitOptions]'RemoveEmptyEntries')[0]}

```
